        Hey! I'm Marco, a Junior Full Stack Developer based in Melbourne,
        Australia, with a passion for crafting beautiful, user-friendly web
        experiences. While I enjoy working across the full stack, I have a
        particular love for frontend development, where creativity and
        functionality come together.

        I'm enthusiastic about all things tech, from building my own computers,
        to tinkering with projects and code, to transforming website ideas to
        life. I am constantly learning and improving my skills, largely driven
        by my curiosity for the benefits, advancements, and fun that technology
        can offer.

        spending time with family & friends. :)
