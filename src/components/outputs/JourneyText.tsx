        My journey into tech is not uncommon in the sense that it hasn't been entirely straight-forward; But I would say that it is unique.

        I have always had a love for technology, even starting from a few years old and using the family computer through dial-up internet!
        My curiousity always led me to explore the amazing things that computers could do, often leading to me crashing it, but also allowing me to troubleshoot and fix it - I essentially fell in love and learnt through brute force. :)

        Although this curiousty and passion remained throughout my life, I had just never really considered IT as a career path for me, and so it never eventuated.
        This led me to explore a range of other opportunities and explored various domains, from business studies, to hospitality, to manufacturing work.
        Although I am thankful for these experiences, the great people I have worked alongside, and the wealth of information and development I've received, I realised that I should invest my career focus towards my passion instead.

        I undertook a web development bootcamp, and immediately knew that this was the road I want to go down.
        The mixture of creativity and technicality was a perfect combination of what I was seeking.
        Fast-forward to today, and I am still putting in the time and effort to upskill and ensure this dream becomes a reality - it is a lifetime learning journey that I am ready for.
        I am currently a Junior Developer, but with enough time and dedication, I am certain that I will be able to fulfil my desire of contributing to meaningful projects in the future.
