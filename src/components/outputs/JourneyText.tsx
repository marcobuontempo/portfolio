        My journey into tech has not been entirely straight forward! Although
        that may not be entirely uncommon, I would say that I have taken a
        unique path.

        I have always had a love for technology, even starting from a few years
        old and using the family computer through dial-up internet! My curiosity
        always led me to explore the amazing things that computers could do,
        often leading to me crashing it, but also allowing me to troubleshoot
        and fix it - I essentially fell in love and learnt through brute force.

        Although this curiosity and passion remained throughout my life, I had
        just never really considered IT as a career path for me, and so it never
        eventuated. This led me to explore a range of other opportunities and
        various domains, from business studies, to hospitality and manufacturing
        work. Although I am thankful for these experiences, the great people I
        have worked alongside, and the wealth of information and development
        I've received, I realised that I should invest my career focus towards
        my passion instead.

        I undertook a web development bootcamp, and immediately knew that this
        was the road I want to go down. The mixture of creativity and
        technicality was a perfect combination of what I was seeking.
        Fast-forward to today, and this commitment to continuous learning and
        upskilling has only increased, and I am eager to further contribute my
        knowledge and skills to high-quality projects!
